# Valorant-Bot
Just a Valorant tracker Discord bot with a friend for now.

## Prerequisites
If you don't already have python installed make sure to install python from: \
https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to install the a couple dependencies, you can install them with the below command:
```
pip install discord.py requests
```
From there you'll need to create a file named variables.py with: 
``` python
discord_token = "Your Discord Bot Token"
guild_id = server id you want to use it on
henrikdev_token = "henrikdev token for the api gotten from their discord server"
```
